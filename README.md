# geminabox

Installs and manages geminabox

## WIP

This is a work-in-progress. The main issues are

- [ ] Gemfile.lock is required for `bundle install --deployment`
- [ ] Do we depend on nginx/apache/etc here?

Until these are worked out, I'm not prepared to make an official release of
this module to the forge
